hosted_on: -> resolve compute and get connection
connects_to: -> resolve compute and get connection + port?



variables may have computed values they are exported as a json

software components always resolve host and try to get connection

atm only ipaddress

while orchestration phase set these vars in model as well
super hard problem with properties are not set at component but parent




e.g. image with tomcat
next step use that as base and then execute own stuff



hosted_on:
    reiche properties durch bis compute
connect_to:
    nur properties vom aktuellen übergeben


docker ideas:
every step own docker image
reference image from step before as base
